I. Installing the easy way.

1. Download the following archive file:

   ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amslatex.zip

For the amsrefs package, download also

   ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amsrefs.zip

and carry out step 4 (steps 2 and 3 can be skipped).

2. View the following files to assess the effects of the upgrade on
your system:

  source/latex/amsmath/diffs-m.txt
  source/latex/amscls/diffs-c.txt

3. Backup the old version of AMS-LaTeX, preferably by moving it out of
the TEXMF tree.

4. Extract files from the .zip archive using your favorite unzip tool, setting
the extraction target directory to the texmf root directory.

5. To check the end result, you should find that you now have amsmath.sty
in the following location

  TEXMF/tex/latex/amsmath/amsmath.sty

Some TeX systems also use a database to keep track of TeX input files.
If this database is not updated, your TeX system might not find the
newly installed files.  Consult your TeX system's documentation to
determine how to update this database.

6. Some files will appear in both the source area and another area.
This is because the source form and the in-use form are identical.
As distributed, the files in the source/latex/ams* areas comprise a
complete copy of the distribution from which all the other files can
be regenerated if need be. If you need to conserve disk space, you
could delete the files in the source area, since they are not needed
for normal use.
